# Contributing

I love pull requests from everyone. Contributing is easy:

* You can report bugs and request features using the [issues page][issues].

[issues]: https://github.com/zokeber/terraform-ec2-centos7-docker/issues

* You can easily work on the code if you have a GitHub account ([get one][github]):

[github]: https://github.com/join

Fork the project, then clone the repo:

    git clone git@github.com:zokeber/terraform-ec2-centos7-docker.git

Make your change(s).

Push to your fork and [submit a pull request][pr].

[pr]: https://github.com/zokeber/terraform-ec2-centos7-docker/compare/

At this point you're waiting for me. I like to at least comment on pull requests
as soon as possible. I may suggest some changes or improvements or alternatives.

Some things that will increase the chance that your pull request is accepted:

* Write a [good commit message][commit].
